# RSA-Homomorphic Encryption with Extended Euclidean Algorithm and Affine Transformation (RSA-HE-EEA-Affine)

In today's digital landscape, safeguarding sensitive information during its transmission over the internet is paramount. The escalating frequency of cyber-attacks underscores the critical need for robust data security measures. Cryptographic techniques have long been employed to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data. However, the emergence of cloud computing has introduced new complexities, necessitating innovative encryption methodologies to mitigate associated risks.

Homomorphic encryption has emerged as a promising solution, particularly in cloud environments. This project introduces an enhanced iteration of the RSA algorithm, leveraging multiple sets of public keys in conjunction with homomorphic and affine encryption techniques.
